### What is Why!?space?
Good question, well asked! Why!?space is a script, written in Python, that cleans up common mistakes found within masses of code. Generic faults it looks for are:
* Trailing whitespace
* No extra line break at the end of the file
* Windows line endings
* Incorrect spacing, for example `if( something){` instead of `if (something) {`
* Incorrect tab spacing
* Tabs, at all
* ... and much, much more!

It is still early days, so customisation is very limited at the moment. It has been created for PHP and Drupal coding standards, but in the long run I hope to make it available for all languages and coding standards.
